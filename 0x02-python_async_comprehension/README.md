# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension

This project is part of the ALX School curriculum and focuses on asynchronous comprehension in Python.

## Description

In this project, we will explore the concept of asynchronous comprehension in Python. Asynchronous comprehension allows us to write concise and efficient code for handling asynchronous operations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the basics of asynchronous programming in Python
- Use async comprehensions to perform asynchronous operations
- Handle errors and exceptions in asynchronous code
- Implement best practices for writing efficient and maintainable asynchronous code

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you will need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Any additional dependencies will be specified in the project's requirements.txt file

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/addymwenda12/0x02-python-async-comprehension.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 0x02-python-async-comprehension`
3. Install the project dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the main script: `python main.py`
