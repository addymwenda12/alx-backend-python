# 0x01. Python - Async

This project covers the topic of asynchronous programming in Python. It explores the concepts of coroutines, tasks, and event loops, and how they can be used to write efficient and responsive code.

## Introduction

In this project, we will dive into the world of asynchronous programming in Python. We will learn how to write asynchronous code using coroutines, tasks, and event loops, and understand the benefits of using async/await syntax.

## Installation

To use the code in this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the asynchronous features in this project:

- `python3 async_example.py`
- `python3 awaitable_example.py`

**async_example.py**
This file demonstrates the usage of coroutines and event loops in Python. It showcases how to define and run asynchronous functions using the `async` keyword and how to await the results of asynchronous tasks using the `await` keyword.
python's asyncio module provides a way to write single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines and event loops. The following example demonstrates
```python
import asyncio

async def my_async_function():
    # Your asynchronous code here
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Async function completed")

async def main():
    # Create an event loop
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

    # Run the async function
    await my_async_function()

    # Close the event loop
    loop.close()

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```
