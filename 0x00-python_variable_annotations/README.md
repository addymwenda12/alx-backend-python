## 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
In this project, I learnt about variable annotations in Python. 
These are the files:

1. `0-add.py`: A type-annotated function that takes two float arguments and returns their sum as a float.
2. `1-concat.py`: A type-annotated function that takes two string arguments and returns a concatenated string.
3. `2-floor.py`: A type-annotated function that takes a float argument and returns the floor of the float as an integer.
4. `3-to_str.py`: A type-annotated function that takes a float argument and returns the string representation of the float.
5. `4-define_variables.py`: A script that defines and annotates four variables with the specified values.
6. `5-sum_list.py`: A type-annotated function that takes a list of floats as an argument and returns their sum as a float.
7. `6-sum_mixed_list.py`: A type-annotated function that takes a list of integers and floats as an argument and returns their sum as a float.
8. `7-to_kv.py`: A type-annotated function that takes a string and an integer or float as arguments and returns a tuple.
9. `8-make_multiplier.py`: A type-annotated function that takes a float as an argument and returns a function that multiplies a float by the input float.
10. `9-element_length.py`: A type-annotated function that takes an iterable object as an argument and returns a list of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is the item from the iterable and the second element is the length of the item.

## Usage
To use the functions in this project, run the corresponding script with the python3 command. For example, to use the add function from `0-add.py`, run the following command:
```bash
$ python3 0-add.py
```
This will print the result of calling the add function with two float arguments.

To run the tests for each script, run the corresponding main.py script with the `python3` command. For example, to run the tests for `0-add.py`, run the following command:

```bash
$ python3 0-main.py
```

This will print the result of the.py

Edit
Full Screen
Copy code
This will print the result of the tests for the tests `add` function.

The repository for this project is [ for the `add` function.al.
